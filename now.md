 <h1>What I'm doing now</h1>
 <p>This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>. Last updated July 22, 2025.</p>

 <h2>Work</h2>
 <p>I'm currently working at <a href="https://langchain.com/">LangChain</a>, where I'm focused on developing open-source packages, primarily <code>langchain</code>. I'm particularly excited about our efforts to standardize model output through a unified interface.</p>

 <h2>Life</h2>
 <p>I recently moved to the Cambridge/Boston area. I've been having a great time exploring my new city, learning about its history, and going to concerts in the area. When I'm at home, I've been geeking out and setting up the home network in my apartment.</p>
    <p>On the side, I'm still doing occasional volunteer development for <a href="https://www.teenstotrails.org/">Teens to Trails</a> and <a href="https://wbor.org/">WBOR</a>.</p>

 <h2>Future</h2>
 <p>I haven't been doing as much film photography lately, but it's something I'd like to get back into soon.</p>
