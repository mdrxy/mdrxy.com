 <h1>What I'm doing now</h1>
 <p>This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>. Last updated October 29, 2025.</p>

 <h2>Work</h2>
 <p>I work at <a href="https://langchain.com/">LangChain</a>, where I develop a myriad of open-source packages (primarily <code>langchain</code>).</p>

 <h2>Life</h2>
 <p>Over the summer I picked up cycling. It's been a great way to explore the Boston metro area. Otherwise, I try to get out to the mountains when time permits for a nice hike.</p>
    <p>On the side, I'm still doing occasional volunteer development for <a href="https://www.teenstotrails.org/">Teens to Trails</a> and <a href="https://wbor.org/">WBOR</a>.</p>

 <h2>Future</h2>
 <p>I haven't been doing as much film photography lately, but it's something I'd like to get back into soon.</p>
